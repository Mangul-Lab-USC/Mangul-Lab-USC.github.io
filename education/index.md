## CXPT 501: Biomedical Data Sciences

The objective of this course is to train students in state-of-the-art tools and methods for reproducible, rigorous, and reproducible biomedical data analysis, including methods to visualize display data and perform appropriate statistical analysis. 

## CXPT 599/PHRD 599: Introduction to Pharmaceutical Bioinformatics

In recent years, the proliferation of the next-generation sequencing techniques has ignited a transformative revolution in pharmaceutical sciences, enabling researchers to harness genomic data for drug discovery. Next-generation sequencing enables researchers not only to analyze genomes but also to unravel genetic factors underlying diseases, identify potential drug targets, and design more effective therapies that can prevent disease progression. This course is designed to equip students with no prior knowledge to gain an in-depth understanding of state-of-the-art bioinformatics techniques and tools within the dynamic realm of pharmaceutical research, and practical applications in drug discovery and development.

## BPSI 412: Targeted and Precision Medicines

Most medical treatments have been designed for the "average patient" as a one-size-fits-all approach, which may be successful for some diseases. Precision medicine, alternatively called "personalized medicine", represents an innovative approach to tailoring disease prevention and treatment by considering differences in people's genes, and the impact of their environments or lifestyles. Advances in precision medicine have already led to powerful novel discoveries and FDA-approved treatments that are tailored to specific characteristics of individuals, such as a person's genetic makeup, or the genetic profile of an individual's disease. The objective of this undergraduate course is to train students in the state-of-the-art tools and methods for bioinformatics analysis of next-generation data. Secondary objectives include studies of example drugs from pharma or biotech (small molecules or biologics) as medical modalities, that have been discovered, developed, and approved based on principles of targeting specific genetic drivers of disease. Primary and secondary objectives will render a global understanding around expertise in bioinformatics, pharmacology, diagnostics, and regulation which facilitate bringing precision drugs to patients.
