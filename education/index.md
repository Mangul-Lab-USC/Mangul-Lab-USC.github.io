## CXPT 501: Biomedical Data Sciences

The objective of this course is to train students in state-of-the-art tools and methods for reproducible, rigorous, and reproducible biomedical data analysis, including methods to visualize display data and perform appropriate statistical analysis. 

## CXPT 599/PHRD 599: Introduction to Pharmaceutical Bioinformatics

In recent years, the proliferation of the next-generation sequencing techniques has ignited a transformative revolution in pharmaceutical sciences, enabling researchers to harness genomic data for drug discovery. Next-generation sequencing enables researchers not only to analyze genomes but also to unravel genetic factors underlying diseases, identify potential drug targets, and design more effective therapies that can prevent disease progression. This course is designed to equip students with no prior knowledge to gain an in-depth understanding of state-of-the-art bioinformatics techniques and tools within the dynamic realm of pharmaceutical research, and practical applications in drug discovery and development.
