  description: "Our talk was highlighted in the blog post of the Journal, GigaScience (http://gigasciencejournal.com/blog/birthday-at-ismb2022/). The first year PhD student, Yu Ning, was a speaker at the 2022 ISMB conference held in Madison, where he presented in the CAMDA (Critical Assessment of Mass Data Analysis) track. During the conference, he presented two talks, Data availability of open T-cell receptor repertoire data, a systematic assessment and Assessing the completeness of immunogenetics databases across diverse populations. The talk for the assessment of the raw data availability in immunogenetics studies introduced the published research in June 2022 examining the raw data availability in the immunogenetics studies. He also presented the ongoing immunogenetics projects analyzing the completeness of the immunogenetics database (IMGT databased) representing diverse populations. The PI, Dr Serghei Mangul, presented one talk, The systematic assessment for the completeness of metadata information accompanying omics studies. His talk centered around the analysis of the completeness of metadata in biomedical research fields. The ISMB conference is a well-respected platform for scientists and researchers in computational biology and your participation in this conference highlights your standing in the industry. The CAMDA track specifically focuses on the critical evaluation of large-scale data analysis. Our talk provided valuable insights into the current state of the field and paved the way for further research and discussions."

  description: "In their comment,'Another recent study affirms that online meetings can promote participant diversity by minimizing barriers to attendance. The authors analyzed the demographics of attendees at scientific conferences before and after the adoption of a virtual format. They observed a significant increase in attendees from underrepresented groups at the virtual events and suggest online platforms may be more inclusive by offering increased accessibility and programming flexibility compared to in-person convenings.'"

  description: " In their comment, Serghei Mangul and colleagues discuss how genomics and metagenomics methods have become essential public health tools. Once the virus was detected, scientists immediately set about identifying and characterizing the pathogen, enabled by access to reliable and accurate sequencing methods. Similarly, computational tools allowed phylogenetic analyses of the genetic fingerprint of the virus that traced its origin and evolution; by these methods, SARS-CoV-2 was found to have close ancestral ties with bat coronavirus species. Genomic and bioinformatic methods continue to be used across the globe to monitor the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants and track transmission routes."

  description: "Dottie Yu is a third year undergraduate in the QCB department and has been working on this project since June 2021. This project evaluates and benchmarks the performance of the 12 existing RNA-seq based HLA callers for their performance in allele typing of the HLA genes, an essential immune-related locus of the human genome. Systematic and comprehensive benchmarking is crucial to helping researchers and clinicians make informed decisions on which HLA caller tool is best for their purposes."
