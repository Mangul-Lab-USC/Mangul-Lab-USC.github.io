### Overview
Joon is a geneticist whose research focuses on identifying and characterizing genetic risk variants in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). As a postdoctoral researcher at UCSF, he has been working on the analysis of whole genome sequencing data for the discovery of noncoding loci in ASD. Working with numerous collaborators, he plays an integral role in developing a framework to identify high-confidence *de novo* and rare inherited variant from whole genome sequencing data and performing a rigorous association test to identify ASD associated noncoding loci.â€‹
