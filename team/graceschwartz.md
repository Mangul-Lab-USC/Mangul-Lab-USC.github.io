### Overview
Grace comes from a diverse background in science, having worked in academia, Biotech, and the food and beverage industry. Her work has ranged from testing the efficacy of synthetic nanoparticle vaccines, to studying the effects of predation risk on the marine snail, Nucella lapillus, to working in quality control at a brewery. She represents the entirety of the Sanders wet lab, where she works on sample collection (in collaboration with the UCSF Center for Maternal Fetal Precision Medicine), mouse whole brain clearing and imaging, library preparation for next generation sequencing, and anything else that comes her way. She truly enjoys the variation of different projects that she is involved in and thinks they will benefit her in future graduate studies.
