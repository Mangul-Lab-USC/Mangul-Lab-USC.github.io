### Overview
Lindsay completed her bachelor's degree at the University of Toronto in 2017, specializing in Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Computer Science. During her undergraduate studies, Lindsay worked in a bacterial genomics lab where she developed her background skills in bioinformatic analysis and software development. As a bioinformatics programmer in the Psychiatry Bioinformatics Core (Psychcore), she works to build a variety of bioinformatic software tools in order to accurately and efficiently process large quantities of genomic data. Currently, she's working with the other members of Psychcore on a sophisticated cloud-based pipeline which combines several AWS services (StepFunctions, Lambda, Batch), Docker container technology, Google Cloud Platform, and Hail for complex genomic analysis.
