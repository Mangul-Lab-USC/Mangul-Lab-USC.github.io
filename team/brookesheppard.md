Brooke is an epidemiologist whose research focuses on identifying and characterizing the role of genetics in neurodevelopmental disorders.  Her graduate work involved investigating common variants associated with phenotypic heterogeneity and patterns of comorbidity in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).  As a postdoctoral researcher at UCSF, she is contributing to ASD gene discovery efforts with the use of rare inherited and de novo variants identified from genomic sequencing data.
