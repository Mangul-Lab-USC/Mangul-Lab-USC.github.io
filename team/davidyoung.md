### Overview
David is a postdoc and a pediatric neurologist whose interest is in the localization of neuropsychiatric disease, particularly neurodevelopmental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). He is currently using lightsheet microscopy and tissue clearing techniques for high-throughput imaging of whole, intact mouse brains. Using computer vision approaches, he is also building an automated pipeline for volumetric reconstruction of brains with individual cell detection. He is applying this imaging informatics pipeline to ASD mouse models to identify convergent changes during development that may underlie where, when, and how ASD occurs. In his spare time, when he's not coding at his computer, he's at another computer coding his football simulator. He and his wife also enjoy finding new trails to hike.
