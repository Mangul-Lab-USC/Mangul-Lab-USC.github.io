### Overview
Shan's research interest is using bioinformatics approach to detect potential genetic risk factors of neurodevelopmental disorders and investigating their contribution to disease etiology. Her previous work has demonstrated the contribution of de novo insertions and deletions in ASD risk and identified two novel ASD genes, KMT2E and RIMS1(Dong et al. 2014). She is also trying to investigate the relationship between genetic risk factors (i,e, de novo mutations) with environmental risk factors, such as smoking. As a member in Psychiatry Bioinformatics Core (PsychCore), her research involved developing new pipelines for both biological and clinical research on whole genome sequencing data and whole exome sequencing data, as well as interpreting the clinical significance of genetic variants.
