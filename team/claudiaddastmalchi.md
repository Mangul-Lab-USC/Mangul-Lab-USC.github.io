### Overview
As a staff bioinformatics programmer in the Sanders Lab’s Psychiatry Bioinformatics Core (PsychCore), Claudia’s main focus has been on co-developing an automated, cloud-based NGS pipeline that can take in raw sequencing data, call variants, and conduct downstream analyses on these variants for large scale samples. This has required the integration and thorough understanding of AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Hail. Previously, Claudia studied Biotechnology in graduate school, during which she engaged in an internship with the responsibility of processing mutation data from variant databases (HGMD, ClinVar, OMIM, Uniprot) and identifying disease connections at the molecular level (mainly protein domains). Claudia’s main passion has been in transforming healthcare by using computational tools to gain beneficial insight from genomic data and ultimately influencing personalized medicine.
