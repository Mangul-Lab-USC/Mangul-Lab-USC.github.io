Five members of the lab were invited to give talks at the [NGSymposium in Computational Biology](https://ngschool.eu/ngsymposium2022). Yesha M. Patel, a Senior Data Scientist in our lab, presented a research project titled "Seeing beyond the target: leveraging off-target reads in clinical tumor sequencing to identify prognostic biomarkers and survival." Mohammad Vahed, a postdoctoral researcher in our lab, presented a research project titled "A comprehensive analysis of the reusability of public omics data across 2.8 million research publications". Karishma Chhugani, a PhD student in our lab, presented a research project titled "A trans ancestry genomics based approach studying interplay between the immune system, infectious type, HLA type, and sepsis outcome". Ram Ayyala, a master's student who graduated from our lab, presented a research project titled "Rigorous benchmarking of HLA callers for RNA sequencing data". Serghei Mangul, the PI of our lab, presented a research project titled "Rigorous benchmarking of T cell receptor repertoire profiling methods for cancer RNA sequencing‚Äù, this project is led by Kerui Peng, a PhD student in our lab.

NGSymposium in Computational Biology is an international conference to celebrate the 5th edition of NGSchool Summer Schools. It is a platform for computational biologists from different areas to present their work and establish potential future collaborations. It took place on September 23rd and 24th, 2022 in Warsaw, Poland.
