## First RECOMB-Seq talk from Mangul Lab

Congratulations to Nathan LaPierre, a PhD student in [ZarLab at UCLA](http://zarlab.cs.ucla.edu/) and a collaborator with Mangul Lab at USC, on the acceptance of his oral presentation, “Metalign: Efficient alignment-based metagenomic profiling via containment min hash,” in the [RECOMB-Seq](https://www.recomb2020.org/recomb-seq-satellites) [Massively Parallel Sequencing virtual satellite meeting](https://www.recomb2020.org/recomb-seq-satellites).

Along with co-authors [Mohammed Alser](https://mealser.github.io/) (Senior Researcher and Lecturer of computer architecture and bioinformatics at the Department of Computer Science, ETH Zürich), [Eleazar Eskin](http://zarlab.cs.ucla.edu/) (Professor of Computational Medicine, Computer Science, and Human Genetics at UCLA), [David Koslicki](https://science.psu.edu/bio) (Associate Professor of Computer Science and Engineering, Biology, and the Huck Institute of the Life Sciences at Penn State), and Serghei Mangul, Nathan presents a novel method that significantly improves the taxonomic profiling accuracy of a metagenomic sample. A manuscript presenting Metalign is currently under second round of review at Genome Biology.

Nathan will present his work at the RECOMB-Seq Massively Parallel Sequencing virtual satellite meeting, which takes place remotely from June 26 to 27, 2020. Registration is free: [https://forms.gle/LCV5b9wQSfSorpab8](https://forms.gle/LCV5b9wQSfSorpab8).
