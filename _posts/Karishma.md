Thank you to USC School of Pharmacy for featuring me in this monthâ€™s (February 2021) Graduate Program Newsletter! I presented virtually on "Comprehensive Analysis of Usability and Archival Stability of RNA-seq Tools" at the Australian Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Society Conference 2020 (ABACBS 2020). Attending and presenting at conferences is a great opportunity as it can help form new connections, lead to new insights, and help broaden your horizon on scientific topics which are novel!
