### Ultimate Guide: BIG Summer 2023

BIG Summer Research Symposium and Poster Presentation!

I participated in BIG Summer 2023 this summer, and the program offers an unparalleled opportunity for undergraduates to delve into the complexities of genomics! 
The program lasted from June 20 to August 11, 2023, and the final application deadline was March 1, 2023, but I applied for an early review admission which deadline was set on January 3, 2023.
Under the guidance of esteemed UCLA faculty mentors, participants get to apply their newfound knowledge to original research projects within the lab setting.
Participants can sign up for workshop sessions introducing students to next-generation sequencing data and statistical analysis methods, such as RNA-SEQ, Single Cell analysis with R, and GitHub/Docker. 

Additionally, the weekly seminar every Friday, led by esteemed UCLA faculty mentors, bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world applications. I felt like each week, as we gather to discuss a variety of bioinformatics/Computer Science topics and exchange ideas, I see the world through a new lens. After the seminar, different UCLA research labs take turns hosting happy hour gatherings, so you get to hang out with friends you made and ask questions to faculty members while enjoying great food!

I can’t forget to mention the weekly journal club. Based on your research interests, you get assigned to a 3-4 member group, and each meeting walks students through a peer-reviewed journal article led by a UCLA professor: For me, Dr. Ophoff led our group and gave a lot of comments on how to approach and present research articles. I awas very thankful!

As I reflect on my time with the program, it’s not just the knowledge that stands out; it's the incredible people I met and the friendships I formed. Students get to hang out and explore LA, such as The Getty, LACMA, Santa Monica Pier, and the Griffith Park Observatory!

BIG Summer extends a friendly hand to social networking. Engaging activities like a Welcome BBQ party at Dr. Hoffman’s house fostered connections between students, UCLA faculty members, and graduate students. I have also received some incredible networking opportunities which have provided me great opportunities for professional and career development. BIG summer is a stepping stone towards a future defined by curiosity, exploration, and scientific discovery!

I highly recommend BIG Summer!
