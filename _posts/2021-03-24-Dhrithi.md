A big thank you to USC School of Pharmacy for featuring me in the Graduate Program Newsletter for participating in the Australian Bioinformatics and Computational 
Biology Society Conference 2020 (ABACBS 2020) and presenting a talk titled 'Comprehensive Analysis of Code and Data Availability in Biomedical Research'. Participating 
in this conference helped me connect with and learn more about the novel scientifc reserach being done from the experts in the field!
