## End Year Celebration

Our group is celebrating the end of a productive calendar year—and the conclusion of our first semester at USC School of Pharmacy! We are proud to share the preprints and papers we produced with our incredible collaborators at ZarLab in the Department of Computational Medicine at UCLA, members of our own group now in the Titus Department of Clinical Pharmacy at USC, and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Consortium.

Earlier this week, we celebrated our lab’s accomplishments in Fall 2019 with a festive dinner of exotic meat and plant-based sausages at Wurstküche in the Arts District in downtown Los Angeles! Our group enjoyed having a chance to socialize outside the lab and, for our graduate students, relax after taking final exams.

On a related note, the Mangul Lab started a new tradition to celebrate the release of our preprints and papers! Each time a member of our group submits a preprint, we celebrate with a social lab gathering. The member who contributed most substantially to the preprint has the honors of pinning a copy of the paper on the left side of a wall in our lab. We then toast to the paper with refreshments! When a preprint is accepted and published by a journal, we celebrate again, and the contributing author moves the paper over the right side of the wall. This particular evening, we pinned and toasted to the four preprints our lab produced in 2019!

Please see below for a complete list of preprints and publications released by our group during 2019.
