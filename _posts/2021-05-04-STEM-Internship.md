## Now recruiting: 2021-2022 Undergraduate STEM Intern!
 
We are actively accepting applications from current undergraduate STEM students to fill the position of an Undergraduate Researcher at the Mangul Lab for Summer 2021.

The Mangul Lab is committed to ensuring an inclusive and supportive environment regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, race, ethnicity, religion, nationality, or socioeconomic background.

### DEADLINE TO APPLY?
Thursday, May 20, 2021 5:00pm Pacific Time
(We will be interviewing candidates on a rolling basis, we encourage you to apply early)

### WHO SHOULD APPLY?
Undergraduate students who are interested in computational bioscience research and have basic computational training are invited to join Mangul Lab from June 16th, 2021, to August 20, 2021. The intern will perform individual research projects, guided by Dr. Mangul, in collaboration with and assistance from our graduate students and postdoctoral scholars. 

*Applications from traditionally underrepresented students will receive priority consideration and are HIGHLY encouraged to apply. To be eligible, you must be enrolled at Santa Monica College.*

Candidates must be eligible to work in the United States. 

### WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE INTERNSHIP?
Intern will spend approximately 10-12 hours each week working on their own robustness and reproducibility project, which presents an excellent opportunity to develop competency in various aspects including designing a project, learning to work with Unix and Python scripts, implementing and debugging software packages, and pipelines, analyzing data obtained from statistical tests and data visualization, curating project materials for long-term storage on GitHub, and producing a scholarly scientific report consisting of aims, methods, results and interpretation. Interns will each be assigned their own desk for the duration of their internship in our computational lab located in the Center for the Health Professions Building (CHP) 236, on the USC Health Sciences Campus (HSC). Alternatively, if needed, interns will work remotely and all the resources can be accessed in remote settings. Due to the multidisciplinary nature of computational genomics and biomedical research, interns will collaborate with different faculty and researchers from different departments and universities. 
 
Note: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the intern hosted by Mangul Lab will perform work remotely.  We are prepared to accommodate a student who works remotely from different time zones. *Subject to change depending on the guidelines issued by USC*

### STUDENT STIPEND

The successful applicant will be employed by USC and paid $3000 over the period of the internship. 

### PROJECT SUMMARY

Mangul Lab designs, develops, and applies novel data-driven, computational approaches that accelerate the diffusion of genomics and biomedical data into translational research and education. Mangul Lab undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs, and PI create novel bioinformatics methods and apply these tools to big data; perform benchmarking studies to assess genomics methods and help researchers select the right tools for a project; and work to increase the installability and archival stability of bioinformatics software.

We will provide the intern with hands-on training, with our main aim being - gaining competency in using computational genomics tools for big data analytic techniques (BDAT) and scientific replicability, and a realistic multidisciplinary research experience at the level of a typical first-year graduate student.

#### SAMPLE PROJECTS

We propose research projects that are well-suited to model for the URAP Fellow how scientific methods, data, and ideas translate in real-time. Each benchmarking study will require the Fellow to select performance metrics relevant to their research questions; document their work as they install, run, and debug each computational tool; generate summary statistics using open-source genomics tools; interpret results in the context of major scientific questions; and present project materials on an open-source data-sharing platform. 

(1) Benchmarking of computational genomics tools designed for read alignment, quantification, and detection of structural variants in genomic data, to assess their robustness and reproducibility. <br/>

(2) Benchmarking of computational methods developed to perform error-correction on next-generation sequencing data. Errors present in genomic data may impact downstream analysis and limit the applicability of sequencing technologies in clinical tools. <br/>

(3) Benchmarking of gene expression deconvolution tools, which are designed to estimate cell type abundance using gene expression data. <br/>

(4) Develop robust and scalable methods to assemble V(D)J alleles from next-generation sequencing data and robust species- and strain-specific methods to assemble B and T cell receptor repertoire from next-generation sequencing data.

### REQUIRED ACTIVITIES IN ADDITION TO RESEARCH

(1) Participate in the weekly lab meetings in CHP 236 or via teleconferencing means. The Fellow will be responsible for weekly presentations of results and issues encountered, as well as at least one formal oral presentation (with slides) per academic term. <br/>

(2) Write a two-page perspective paper, supported by five scholarly references, discussing the role of scientific reproducibility in research ethics. <br/>

(3) Create a formal poster presentation of project aims, methods, and results, to be presented at an end-of-the-year Mangul Lab social event. Our graduate students and postdoctoral scholars will guide the Interns in developing and presenting their posters. <br/>

We will also encourage the Intern to submit their work to national conferences. The interns will be encouraged to, and supported in, preparing a manuscript for submission to a peer-reviewed journal, on successful completion of the project.

Note: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all lab activities are currently conducted via teleconferencing means. *Subject to change depending on the guidelines issued by USC*

### SELECTION CRITERIA

(1) Computational background (Experience in Python, Bash shell scripting, Jupyter Notebooks preferred but not required) <br/>
(2) Life science background <br/>
(3) Past academic performance <br/> 
(4) Aptitude for completion of a research project

### ABOUT PI MANGUL

Dr. Mangul has over seven years of experience teaching BDAT and computational genomics techniques to researchers of all levels, including undergraduate students. While a postdoctoral scholar at UCLA, Dr. Mangul developed a three-day “Intro to UNIX” workshop that he taught 15 times to over 300 individuals (2013 to 2019). Dr. Mangul has mentored over 30 undergraduates, including 16 students enrolled in the UCLA Bruins-in-Genomics (B.I.G.) Summer Undergraduate Research Program; he supervised six students who won the Best Poster Award. Six of PI Mangul’s former mentees are now Ph.D. students in bioinformatics at UCLA, UC Davis, and George Washington University. At least 20 of his undergraduate mentees are contributing authors on peer-reviewed publications; with three mentees as the first author. During Fall 2019, Mangul Lab at USC hosted one undergraduate intern from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Dr. Mangul is also mentoring two undergraduate students under the USC URAP 2020-21.
