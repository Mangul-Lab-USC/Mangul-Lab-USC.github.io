Congratulations to [Abdullah Al Nahid](https://mangul-lab-usc.github.io/members/nahid-abdullah.html) on his acceptance into the prestigious Pharmaceutical and Translational Sciences (PHTS) Graduate Program at [USC Alfred E. Mann School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences](https://mann.usc.edu/)!

Abdullah, previously a volunteer researcher from Bangladesh in [Mangul Lab](https://mangul-lab-usc.github.io/), has worked on two projects in the lab: benchmarking HLA callers for RNA-seq data and the methods to estimate SARS-CoV-2 lineage abundance in wastewater.

Abdullahâ€™s hard work, dedication, and passion for the field have led him to this remarkable achievement. This accomplishment not only reflects his exceptional academic and research capabilities but also marks the beginning of a new journey.

Starting his Ph.D. career, Abdullah aims to work on advancing computational tools in immunogenomics, and making an impact in the field of precision medicine.

Once again, congratulations on your acceptance Abdullah, and your journey at USC promises to be a transformative experience, full of discoveries and opportunities that will shape your career and the field of translational bioinformatics for years to come.
