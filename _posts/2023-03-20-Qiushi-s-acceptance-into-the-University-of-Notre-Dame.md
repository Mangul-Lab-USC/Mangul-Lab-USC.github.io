### Congratulations to Qiushi Peng on acceptance into the University of Notre Dame Graduate Program!
We are thrilled to share with you the news of [Qiushi's](https://mangul-lab-usc.github.io/members/peng-qiushi.html) acceptance into the Graduate Program in Integrated Biomedical Sciences at the University of Notre Dame.  Qiushi Peng is a master's student in the Mangul Lab, which is dedicated to advancing scientific research in the fields of genomics and bioinformatics. This is a remarkable achievement, and we would like to take a moment to extend my warmest congratulations to Qiushi for this tremendous accomplishment.

The University of Notre Dame is a prestigious university in the United States, known for its exceptional academic programs and rigorous research environment. Qiushi's acceptance into this program is a testament to his hard work, dedication, and intellectual curiosity. 

As Qiushi embarks on this new chapter in his academic and professional journey, I have no doubt that they will continue to excel and make important contributions to the field of biomedical science. 

We wish Qiushi all the best as he begins his Ph.D. journey at the University of Notre Dame.
