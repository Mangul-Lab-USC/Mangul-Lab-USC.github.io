## Mangul Lab to present at 2020 ACM-BCB

Congratulations to Mangul Lab postdoc Jaque Brito, whose highlight talk has been accepted for presentation at the [11th ACM Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Health Informatics (ACM BCB)](http://acm-bcb.org/2020/).

Jaque will deliver her talk, “Benchmarking of computational error-correction methods for next-generation sequencing data,” at [ACM-BCB](http://acm-bcb.org/2020/) 2020, which will be held September 21 to 24, 2020, as a virtual conference. The highlight talk will present the methods and results of a project Mangul Lab published in Genome Biology, a benchmarking of currently available error correction tools.

ACM-BCB is a forum for interdisciplinary research linking computer science, mathematics, statistics, biology, bioinformatics, biomedical informatics, and health informatics. The conference showcases leading-edge research on new technologies and techniques around gathering, processing, analyzing, and modeling of data and information for a variety of scientific, clinical, and healthcare applications, from the laboratory to clinical setting.
