## Bench pressing with genomics benchmarkers

A journalist with Nature Methods recently interviewed Serghei on the increasingly important role that benchmarking studies play in biomedical and life science research.

Benchmarking studies, which rank bioinformatics software according to variables such as speed, accuracy, and precision, help researchers select the best tool for a given dataset and research question. However, benchmarking studies also point out when a tool is performing poorly—an unfortunate discovery for the lab that created the software package.

“In a review, Mangul and colleagues note that 72% of benchmarking studies they surveyed exclude information about how computationally efficient a method is. “I was really surprised,” says Mangul.”
