## Welcome to Mangul Lab Anushka 

Mangul Lab welcomes to the team a new Master’s student, Anushka Rajesh!

Anushka is pursuing the Master of Science in [Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of Southern California School of Pharmacy](https://pharmgradprograms.usc.edu/phts/msps/), after earning a Bachelor of Pharmacy degree from [Mumbai University, India](https://mu.ac.in/). She has previous research experience in core pharmaceutical drug design, where she worked on a research project involving formulation of PLGA microspheres for sustained drug release.

Anushka is excited to build upon her experience in research and authoring technical review posters and papers. For her MS thesis, she will be exploring the field of bioinformatics, which is relatively new to her. Anushka looks forward to identifying new ways to leverage bioinformatics to explore the field of healthcare.
