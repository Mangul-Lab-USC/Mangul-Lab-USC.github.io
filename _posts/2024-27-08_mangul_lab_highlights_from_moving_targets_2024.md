### Mangul Lab Highlights from Moving Targets 2024

<p style="text-align: center;">
Our lab members Dhrithi Deshpande and Ella Schwab played key roles in organizing this year’s USC Chapter of AAPS-Led Conference, 
Moving Targets. With support from one of the Moving Targets faculty advisors Dr. Serghei Mangul, their efforts were essential 
to the event’s success, especially in attracting excellent speakers from both industry and academia. The conference theme, 
Computational Data-Driven Drug Discovery and Development, focused on the intersection of bioinformatics and drug discovery, 
showcasing cutting-edge research and advancements in the field. One of the highlights was the engaging panel discussion, 
where speakers shared insights on how computational methods will influence the drug development process and careers in pharmaceutical 
science overall.
