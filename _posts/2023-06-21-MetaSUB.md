Would you like to take part in an exciting, one-day event along with fellow researchers across the globe? Then consider representing Los Angeles in this year’s Global City Sampling Day, hosted by the international MetaSUB Consortium! You can join in at any commitment level, and as a participant you will be swabbing frequently touched objects across LA to sample the microbial composition of areas with high human traffic. These include bus, rail, and subways systems from the heart of Downtown to the beach cities of Santa Monica and Long Beach. Then once the day’s over, your samples will be collected and go on to contribute to a wide body of microbiome research from tracking the spread of antibiotic resistance to identifying novel biosynthetic gene clusters for drug discovery. So mark your calendars for June 21st and sign up by filling out a short registration form below:
