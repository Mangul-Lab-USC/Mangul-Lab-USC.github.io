### My journey to medical school

{% include figure.html image="images/team/dottie-yu.png"%}

My name is [Dottie](https://mangul-lab-usc.github.io/members/yu-dottie.html), I graduated from [USC](https://www.usc.edu/) in 2023 with a bachelors in [Quantitative Biology](https://www.qcb-dornsife.usc.edu/). Very excited to share that I will be starting medical school at the [Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/lerner-college-medicine) with a full-tuition scholarship.

But I didn’t always know I wanted to be a doctor.

### “I think I want a PhD….”

is what I would have said freshman year. Armed with naive curiosity and a vague interest in computational biology, I began reaching out to research labs early on. I soon joined a computational modeling project in Dr. Leonardo Morsut’s lab in the USC Stem Cell department; it was my first ever research experience, and the learning curve was steep. It was my exposure to differential equations, and demanded I learn a whole new set of technical terminology and coding language. 

I was terrified, but over the next two years, I grew tremendously. I wrote my first proposal (for the [USC Provost Undergraduate Research Award](https://careers.usc.edu/experiences/usc-provosts-undergrad-research-fellowships-2/)), made my first presentation (at a [WiSE symposium](https://www.wiseusaf.com/)), held my first journal club, and eventually found myself a co-author on the resulting publication. Above all, I realized that I enjoy computational research. From then on, I wanted computational research to be a primary part of my career aspirations.

### “…or maybe a MD/PhD …”

I began volunteering at a local hospital sophomore year, and that dramatically shifted my career focus. I cherished my time at the hospital. Maybe it was in the happy tears I cried when I had the chance to call the time-of-birth for a newborn baby girl, or the IV contrast I was able to help set up for a stroke patient for their CT scan, or the way I witnessed a surgeon remove an entire gallbladder through a few small laparoscopic incisions… I was amazed by the medical field. Medicine was, to me, the ultimate practice of humanism—it’s a field that unites humans together, all in defiance of fate and illness. I felt profoundly drawn to this purpose.

My hospital experiences gave a deeper purpose to my research. I saw that medicine relies on research, put differently, there would be no medicine without research. I couldn’t imagine foregoing either research or medicine in my career. I began strongly considering pursuing a MD/PhD so I could learn how to become both a clinician and an investigator.

It was at this point that I came across a summer research opportunity in [Dr. Mangul](https://mangul-lab-usc.github.io/members/serghei-mangul.html)’s [lab](https://mangul-lab-usc.github.io), applied, and elated when I was selected for the position. I began working on a project benchmarking HLA callers, which I continue today. Joining the Mangul Lab has been the most formative experience of my undergraduate years; I have always felt incredibly supported and valued here, and I have grown beyond my greatest expectations here. It still feels surreal that I had the amazing opportunity to take on a lead role in a study benchmarking HLA typing algorithms, which is now accepted to the Nature Methods journal as a Stage 1 Registered Report. I am also so grateful for the opportunity to present my research at large conferences, write and revise our manuscript, work as a teaching assistant, and even help with some grant writing. Working here has prepared me immensely to apply to research-focused graduate programs. I can confidently say that I would not be where I am now without Dr. Mangul’s support these past three years.

### “… I want a research-focused MD.”

I felt energized by patient care, and that motivated me to continue seeking out diverse clinical experiences in my upperclassman years. The more patients and physicians I spoke with, the more I gravitated towards a career in medicine. 

I faced indecision between pursuing a MD/PhD or a pure MD… until just weeks before submitting my medical school application, when I heard about Cleveland Clinic Lerner’s 5-year program. This program was everything I had been searching for. The curriculum places strong emphasis on research, with dedicated blocks for basic/translational and clinical research, while being many years shorter than a traditional dual-degree program; they also encourage self-directed learning by removing all grades and exams, and offer a full scholarship to all students. CCLCM quickly became my dream program.

I was overjoyed when I received the acceptance call in February. I am grateful to have received acceptances to many amazing programs including Duke, Vanderbilt, and Northwestern, but I knew I wanted to be at CCLCM.

Looking into the future fills me with excitement—I’m going to be a doctor! I’m beyond grateful to be in this position, knowing I am one step closer to my goal of spending my life treating patients and conducting research to improve the future of medicine.

### Considering an MD?

My advice is to try getting involved in patient care and shadowing!
 
<u>Hospital setting</u>: [COPE Health Scholars](https://copehealthscholars.org/programs/health-scholar/overview/) is a hospital volunteering program that is helpful for getting your foot in the door. They have a site at the Adventist Health White Memorial Hospital ~20 minutes from the USC UPC campus. There are opportunities for direct patient care and shadowing. I also had the chance to observe several surgeries and endoscopies. 

<u>Private practice setting</u>: Indeed usually has many part-time medical assistant job postings, especially if you are bilingual or have special certifications/skills. I found two clinical jobs through Indeed. I recommend trying the private practice setting for exposure to the insurance/billing side of medicine. I also love that I was able to develop close mentorships with the doctors running the practices.

<u>Other</u>: I think EMT and scribing are good opportunities, but I don’t have much personal experience with them.
