My name is Dottie Yu and I am an undergraduate student in the Quantitative Biology BS program at USC. I am very glad to have attended the 2022 QCB Symposium at USC and present a poster of our project, “Rigorous Benchmarking of HLA Callers for RNA Seq Data.” 

I had a fantastic experience at this conference and hope to be back in future years! Katie and all of the other organizers were incredibly warm and welcoming to me and the conference was well organized. I enjoyed the talks - they come from so many diverse fields of computational biology, many of which I rarely get to hear about. In particular, I enjoyed hearing about the computational simulation and prediction projects - it’s very different from the work we do in the Mangul Lab, but sounds very novel and exciting. The conference also allowed me to see how my project in the Mangul Lab fits in with the research being done by other labs, and it was encouraging to hear others recognize and use the HLA callers that my group is benchmarking, validating the usefulness of our work.

I am also so surprised and honored to have been awarded the QCB Google Alumni Award at the banquet! Thank you to Dr. Rohs, Katie, and everyone else in the faculty selection group for recognizing my work. I am so excited to continue engaging with the QCB department and field.
