### Congratulations to Dhrithi Deshpande on her acceptance into the prestigious Pharmaceutical & Translational Sciences (PHTS) Graduate Program at USC Alfred E. Mann School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences!
This is an extraordinary achievement that is a testament to her hard work, dedication, and academic excellence. We are honored to have had [Dhrithi](https://mangul-lab-usc.github.io/members/deshpande-dhrithi.html) as a Master's student in our lab, where she led a review of bioinformatics analysis of RNA-Seq data that was recently published in Frontiers in Genetics. Moreover, her exceptional contributions to multiple projects published in high-profile journals such as Nature Methods and Genome Biology have been outstanding. Dhrithi's acceptance into the PHTS program showcases her commitment to the field of pharmacy and the potential impact she can make. Her research interests, academic achievements, and leadership skills have all contributed to this success, and we have no doubt that she will continue to excel in the Ph.D. program. We are thrilled to see where this new chapter of her academic journey takes her, and we cannot wait to see the significant contributions she will make to the field of pharmaceutical and translational sciences in the years to come. Once again, congratulations to Dhrithi Deshpande on this remarkable accomplishment!
