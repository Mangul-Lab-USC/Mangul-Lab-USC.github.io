## First HiTSeq talk from Mangul Lab

Congratulations to Nathan LaPierre on the acceptance of his abstract to the High Throughput Sequencing (HiTSeq) 2020 virtual meeting.

Nathan will be presenting his talk, “Metalign: Efficient alignment-based metagenomic profiling via containment min hash,” on July 15, 2020.
