### Presenting at RECOMB 2024 Conference and Satellite Events

<div style="text-align: center;">
We are thrilled to announce that our lab results were selected for presentation as posters and talks at both the RECOMB 2024 conference and satellite events. RECOMB 2024 is the 28th Annual International Conference on Research in Computational Molecular Biology, aiming to present how computational and mathematical fields can solve problems in biological science. It was a great opportunity to share our findings and network with peers, gaining valuable feedback.

Our lab members arrived in Boston on April 28th to attend satellite events, all of which are held at The STATA Center, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
