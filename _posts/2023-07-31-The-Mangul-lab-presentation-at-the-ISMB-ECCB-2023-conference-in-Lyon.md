### The Mangul lab presented two talks and two posters at the ISMB/ECCB 2023 conference in Lyon, France

[Yu Ning Huang](https://mangul-lab-usc.github.io/members/huang-yu-ning.html) and his esteemed mentor, Serghei Mangul, left an indelible mark at the ISMB/ECCB2023 conference held in the picturesque city of Lyon, France. With unwavering passion and dedication, they presented their groundbreaking research, captivating the audience and fellow scholars alike.

Yu Ning's presentation on "A Systematic Assessment of the Completeness of TCR Databases across Mus musculus Strains" was nothing short of awe-inspiring. His meticulous evaluation of the IMGT database's representation of four critical Mice strains - NOD, BALB/c, C57BL/6, and C57BL/6J - shed light on the intricacies of T-cell receptor databases and their significance in immunology research. The results revealed that the NOD mice strain is the most underrepresented in the IMGT database, while the C57BL/6J is the most represented. He presented the project as a talk and a poster presentation. His work promises to influence future developments in the field, advancing our understanding of the immune system and paving the way for potential breakthroughs in disease treatment and prevention.

Not to be outdone, Serghei Mangul's talk on "Evaluating the Robustness and Reproducibility of RNA-Seq Quantification Tools" was equally captivating. The project was led by the incoming PhD student, [Cecilia Liu](https://mangul-lab-usc.github.io/members/liu-cecilia.html), in the lab. With a focus on the complex challenges of RNA-Seq quantification, Serghei's research revealed significant variability in computational replicates' ability to maintain consistent gene expression. His study's importance to the biomedical community cannot be overstated, as it equips researchers with critical insights into the reliability and reproducibility of bioinformatics tools. This empowers scientists to make informed decisions when unraveling the mysteries of gene expression, ultimately accelerating discoveries in genomics and personalized medicine.

Additionally, the project led by the students in the lab, [Ram Ayyala](https://mangul-lab-usc.github.io/members/ayyala-ram.html) and [Dottie Yu](https://mangul-lab-usc.github.io/members/yu-dottie.html), titled as “ Rigorous Benchmarking of HLA Callers for RNA-seq Data” was presented as the poster presentation in the conference. The project benchmarked current HLA callers for RNA-sew data.

The collective impact of their research resonated deeply, showcasing the true power of bioinformatics in driving scientific discovery and fostering collaboration. The lab contributions epitomize the spirit of ISMB/ECCB2023 - a platform for sharing knowledge, sparking innovation, and forging meaningful connections that transcend borders and disciplines.
