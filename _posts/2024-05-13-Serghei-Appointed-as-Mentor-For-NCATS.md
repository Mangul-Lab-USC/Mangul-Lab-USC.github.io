### Serghei Appointed as Mentor for NCATS Training Program

We are delighted to announce that Serghei has been appointed as a Mentor for the NCATS (National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences) Training Program. This program is dedicated to fostering diversity in artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) within the field of biomedical research. [The NCATS Training Program](https://www.aim-ahead.net/data-science-training-core/aim-ahead-and-ncats-training-program/) is committed to increasing researcher diversity by providing comprehensive training to individuals from diverse backgrounds, empowering them to excel in AI/ML data analysis and contributing meaningfully to underrepresented communities in biomedical research. In collaboration with the AIM-AHEAD consortium (Data Science Training Core and Communications Hub), this initiative leverages the NCATS N3C Data Enclave to offer a unique training opportunity to stakeholders, trainees, mentees, and consortium partners. The N3C Data Enclave serves as a robust platform enabling researchers to study COVID-19, explore potential treatments, clinical best practices, novel patient cohorts, and interventions amidst the evolving pandemic landscape.

We commend the NCATS Training Program and AIM-AHEAD consortium for their dedication to advancing diversity and innovation in AI/ML research. Together, we are forging a more inclusive and impactful future for biomedical data science.
