### Varuni Sarwal selected as a 2023 Amazon Fellow!

Her nomination stood out among a pool of highly competitive candidates.

The Science Hub is a collaborative effort between UCLA and Amazon with the mission to address humanity’s pressing challenges by cross-pollinating academic and industry research that harnesses the power of artificial intelligence. Every year, the Science Hub will invite UCLA faculty to submit nominations for doctoral student fellows. The fellowships will provide each selected UCLA Samueli doctoral graduate student with funding to pursue independent research projects.

The fellowships will provide each selected doctoral graduate student with up to two quarters of funding during academic-year quarters to pursue independent research projects. Fellows are invited to present their research progress at the annual Science Hub Research Showcase, and to present a lightning talk about their research progress. In addition, the Fellows will be considered for paid summer internships at Amazon, gaining valuable industry insights and experience through direct engagement with Amazon researchers. The students awarded the fellowships will be known as Amazon Fellows.
