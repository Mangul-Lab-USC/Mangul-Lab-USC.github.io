### Congratulations to Grigore Boldirev on acceptance into the Georgia State University Graduate Program!
We are pleased to share the exciting news that one of our exceptional undergraduate students, [Grigore Boldirev](https://mangul-lab-usc.github.io/members/boldirev-grigore.html), has been accepted into the Graduate Program at Georgia State University's Computer Science Department. Grigore will be joining the laboratory of Prof. Zelikovsky and will be co-advised by Prof. Mangul.

This is a tremendous achievement, and we couldn't be prouder of Grigore for his unwavering commitment and hard work that has led him to this significant milestone in his academic journey. Without a doubt, he will excel as a Ph.D. student and bring noteworthy contributions to the field of bioinformatics. Despite being located remotely in Chisinau, Moldova, and facing a 9-hour time difference, Grigore has been an integral part of our team's success and has made significant contributions. His contributions have been priceless, and we have no doubt that he has a bright future ahead of him.

Grigore's acceptance into the graduate program is a testament to his perseverance and dedication, and we offer him our sincerest congratulations. We are thrilled for him and eagerly await the amazing things he will accomplish.
