[Ryan Alomair](https://mangul-lab-usc.github.io/members/alomair-ryan.html), who was previously an undergraduate researcher in the lab, has been accepted into [Georgia State University](https://www.gsu.edu/)â€™s Computer Science PhD program with a concentration in Bioinformatics. This fall, he will be working alongside [Prof. Alexander Zelikovsky](https://sites.google.com/view/gsu-bioinformatics-research-gr/people?authuser=0#h.nzar0tisdivb) and [Prof. Serghei Mangul](https://mangul-lab-usc.github.io/members/serghei-mangul.html).

Ryan's admission to the graduate program stands as evidence of his hard work, resilience, and academic drive. From benchmarking bioinformatic tools to developing data management pipelines, he has honed his skills in conducting large-scale genomic analysis across diverse projects over the last 2.5 years in the lab. With this experience, he brings a wealth of expertise to his new academic endeavor.

Drawing on his exceptional skills and commitment to his academic pursuits, Ryan aims to focus his future research efforts on immunogenetics. We have no doubt he will make significant contributions to the field as he explores new approaches to genomic research. We extend our heartfelt congratulations to Ryan and look forward to witnessing his continued success in the years to come.
