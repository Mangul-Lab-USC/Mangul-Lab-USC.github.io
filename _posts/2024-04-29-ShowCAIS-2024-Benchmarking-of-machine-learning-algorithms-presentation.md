On April 19th, 2024 I gave an oral presentation titled ["Benchmarking of machine learning algorithms to predict mortality in sepsis from transcriptomic data"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=422i02CUumE) at the [ShowCAIS 2024](https://sites.google.com/usc.edu/showcais-2024) here at the [USC Center for AI in Society](https://cais.usc.edu/) in which students and faculty showcased their AI-related research.  The primary goal of the USC Center for AI in Society is to develop, test, iterate, and demonstrate how AI can be used to tackle the most difficult societal problems. Their goal is to help foster genuine partnerships between computer science, operations research, social work, and community organizations.

My presentation consisted of providing background on the sepsis infectious disease, our problem statement, benchmarking methodology, results, current limitations, and future directions. Presenting my talk gave me the opportunity to practice my public speaking skills along with being able to scientifically communicate my results which can be challenging yet rewarding. Attending ShowCAIS 2024 was definitely a highlight, it's always energizing to be surrounded by so many brilliant minds and engaging discussions. Plus, I had the opportunity to learn about the latest health related advancements in AI, chat with other attendees about their projects, and even got a chance to discuss my research in addition to my talk at the poster session. Answering questions from   other students and attendees on my research is really insightful as well because it can help you think about your project and can also spark new ideas. Looking forward to furthering my project and hopefully presenting new results soon.
