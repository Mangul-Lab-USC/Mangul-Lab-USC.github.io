# Where data and biology meet

The Greene Lab is a team of researchers at the [Perelman School of Medicine](https://www.med.upenn.edu/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) dedicated to answering important questions in biology and medicine with computation.
We focus on bringing together publicly available [big data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data), developing new computational methods to analyze that data, and creating tools to put those resources into the hands of every biologist.
