# The Mangul Lab at USC


Mangul Lab is part of the Titus Department of Clinical Pharmacy at [USC Alfred E. Mann School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences](https://pharmacyschool.usc.edu/) and [Department of Quantitative and Computational Biology](https://www.qcb-dornsife.usc.edu/) at [USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences](https://dornsife.usc.edu/). Our research aims to design, develop and apply novel and robust data-driven, computational approaches that will accelerate the diffusion of genomics and biomedical data into translational research and education. Our research is dedicated to all freedom-loving people around the world, to the people of Ukraine who fight for our freedom.

Computational data-driven research focuses on developing and applying computational methods across various types of omics datasets. Such research is performed in a new type of laboratory, often called a dry lab. Our team designs, develops and applies novel and robust data-driven, computational approaches that will accelerate the diffusion of genomics and biomedical data into translational research and education.
