Matt has been translating questions posed by biologists and businesses into software that computers can contemplate for over 20 years.
He earned his Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Applied and Engineering Physics at Cornell University at the same time the Human Genome Project was getting underway.
He has a broad and deep background in using and developing complex computer software.
As a Project Manager for diverse consulting clients, he developed a specialty for systems integration.
He also has worked as a programmer and data analyst in an array of academic settings, including the MIRAGE Alzheimer Disease project at Boston University Medical Center and as a member of the Harvard Computational Biology Initiative, where he played an integral role in creating innovative visual displays of gene networks that became Autworks.
His research interests include visualization of information and human-computer interaction as applied to complex data sets.
At the Greene Lab, he enjoys the challenge of making novel research methods available and useful to a broader audience of biologists
