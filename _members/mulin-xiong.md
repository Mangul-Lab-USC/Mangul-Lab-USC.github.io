Mulin was a [Biology](http://biology.dartmouth.edu/) major and [AMES](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~asia/) minor on the premed track at Dartmouth College.
Mulin's senior project sat at the intersection of computational and wet-bench techniques, which she used to study Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
This opportunistic human pathogen readily forms biofilms and is difficult to treat.
In the Greene lab, Mulin developed and applied new computational approaches to analyze the antibiotic response of Pseduomonas aeruginosa, and, in the Hogan lab, she measured this response to test her computational approach.
Mulin is currently working in clinical research lab in Rochester, New York.
In this lab she is focused on bringing specialized care to patients with movement disorders (such as Parkinson's and Huntington's) using telemedicine.
