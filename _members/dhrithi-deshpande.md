Dhrithi Deshpande is a graduate student doing her Masters in Molecular Phamarcology and Toxicology at the School of Pharmacy at USC. 
She graduated from Dayananda Sagar College of Engineering, Bangalore, India, with a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Biotechnology.
Her undergraduate research experience lies in the eco-toxicological studies and antimicrobial resistance pattern of coliform bacteria, structural, 
and conformational analysis of the drug resistant gene products to devise a novel bacteriophage based therapy for the treatment of lake water. 
Dhrithi was also a Summer Intern at IIT Bombay, where she explored the effects of various micronutrients, lifestyles, and environmental 
parameters on the dynamics of T-cells and B-cells in the body (i.e., quantification of immunity using a systems biology approach). 
She is currently working on studying the robustness and reproducbility of DNA-seq and RNA-seq tools used in biomedical research.
