Daniel [joined](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goIOtEpE8Lc) the Greene Lab as a Postdoctoral Researcher in June 2016, after receiving his PhD in _Biological & Medical Informatics_ at UCSF.
He uses hetnets — networks with multiple types of nodes and relationship — to integrate and learn from the past several decades of biomedical research.
All of Daniel's research is entirely open: openly licensed and immediately available.
Check out his [GitHub](https://github.com/dhimmel/) to follow his recent work.
Daniel also performs many data science projects designed to make science more open and hence productive.
