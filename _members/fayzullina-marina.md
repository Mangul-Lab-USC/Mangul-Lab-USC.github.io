Marina Fayzullina is a first year PhD rotation student at USC School of Pharmacy. In 2018, she got her B.A. in Molecular and Cell Biology, with Neurobiology concentration, from University of California, Berkeley. As an undergraduate, Marina worked as a research assistant in Dr. Lance Kriegsfeld's lab. Her research project focused on the pathophysiological impacts of chronic stress on the female reproductive system in early pregnancy in mouse models. After graduation, Marina started working as a lab technician in Dr. Hong-Wei Dongâ€™s lab at USC Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute, where she has contributed toward mapping all neuronal connections within the mouse brain through anatomical and computational methods. Currently, Marina's research interests include the application of bioinformatics tools in the field of immunogenomics and various disease models. In Dr. Mangul's lab, she will be working on immunogenetics research comparing the ancestry differences in the AIRR sequencing cohorts.
