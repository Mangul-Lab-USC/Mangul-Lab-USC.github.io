Greg was a Ph.D. candidate in the Greene Lab through Penn's [Genomics and Computational Biology (GCB) PhD program](http://www.med.upenn.edu/gcb/).
Greg graduated from The College of New Jersey in 2011 with a B.S. in Biology and from Saint Joseph's University in 2014 with an M.S. in Biology.
He joined the lab in 2015 at Dartmouth and transferred with Casey to Penn.
At Penn, he was awarded a T32 Training Grant.
He has published papers on supervised methods to detect glioblastoma tumors with NF1 inactivation, and unsupervised deep learning methods to aggregate pan-cancer gene expression features.
His goal is to improve outcomes for cancer patients through the development of methods that help unravel the complexity of cancer.
