Qiwen was Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.
She received her PhD in Bioinformatics from North Carolina State University in 2016, where she studied translational regulation in plant genomes.
She developed machine learning and statistical approaches based on high-throughput sequencing datasets to identify regulatory elements that affect transcription and translation.
Qiwen joined the Greene Lab in 2017.
Currently, her research interests focus on integration of different types of high-throughput sequencing data to identify meaningful biological patterns, key transcriptional regulators related to drug addiction and chromatin-regulated alternative splicing using computational approaches.
