Dr. Malomane is a postdoctoral researcher in the group of Dr. Chiang at USC and co-advised by Dr.
Mangul, since 2022. She is interested in exploring patterns of genetic variation in diverse human
populations and their relation to complex traits. Dorcus has a background in population and
evolutionary genomics. She obtained her PhD in 2019 from the University of Goettingen, Germany. In
her PhD work she studied how different geographic distributions, management and breeding practices
have shaped genetic diversity in a wide variety of globally collected chicken populations. Furthermore,
she investigated the genetic patterns of different genomic regions, pathways and genes in the chicken to
explore their subjection to different evolutionary dynamics. Prior to joining the group, she was shortly a
postdoctoral research associate at the University of Goettingen and her work was aimed at developing
genetic markers for ash dieback disease.
