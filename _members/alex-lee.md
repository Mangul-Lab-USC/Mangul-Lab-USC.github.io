Alexandra is a Ph.D. student in the Greene Lab through [Pennâ€™s Genomics and Computational Biology (GCB) PhD Program](https://www.med.upenn.edu/gcb/).
She graduated from Bryn Mawr College with a B.A. in Mathematics and a minor in Computer Science.
She also earned an M.S. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Washington.
Prior to coming to Penn, she worked as a bioinformatics analyst at the J. Craig Venter Institute, where she studied viral genomics.
Since joining the Greene lab in 2018, her research has focused on using deep learning methods to extract patterns from large-scale gene expression datasets.
She is currently applying these methods to understand mechanisms of _P.aeruginosa_ infection.
Her goal is to develop methods that help gain insight into the complexities of disease traits.
