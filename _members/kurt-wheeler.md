Kurt graduated from Drexel University in 2014 with a B.S. in Computer Science.
After working at a tech startup on a Business Intelligence tool for a couple years he decided to try and make a greater impact with his software skills.
He found the Greene Lab and has been happily creating software for researchers since.
Kurt values clean maintainable code, scalable engineering, and ultimately making software that is useful to researchers answering important questions.
