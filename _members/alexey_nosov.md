Alexey is an undergraduate volunteer researcher at Mangul Lab. He obtained his M.S. in Chemistry from Moldova State University in 2006. Since then he worked in academia, pharmaceutical industry, software quality assurance, business management and accounting. However, after moving from Moldova to the U.S., he decided to return back to his original career path in academia. He is currently taking refresher courses in chemistry and other disciplines at Santa Monica College and applying to PhD programs in Chemistry and Pharmacy at USC and other universities of the greater L.A. area. Alexeyâ€™s research interests focus on synthesis of inorganic complex compounds and their application in medicine, catalysis and analytical chemistry. However, he is also looking to expand his research interests into clinical pharmacy and translational sciences, including computational data-driven research conducted at Mangul Lab.
