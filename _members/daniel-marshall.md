Daniel Marshall is an undergraduate studying quantitative biology at the University of Southern
California (Class of 2024) and a student researcher in the Mangul Lab. He previously served as a
volunteer lab technician for the Center for Craniofacial Molecular Biology at USC, analyzing
mouse samples to confirm the presence of introduced genetic mutations and creating CT scan
images for analysis. Daniel also worked on a project imaging algae strains at the cellular level in
the lab of Dr. Rusty Lansford, from summer 2021 through fall 2022. The project aimed to make
progress in creating tools for assessing algae health to develop strains for biofuel farming. He
received a 2022 Summer Undergraduate Research Fund (SURF) grant to conduct the research.
He is a member of Phi Beta Kappa. He enjoys hiking in the open spaces of L.A. and reading
fiction.
