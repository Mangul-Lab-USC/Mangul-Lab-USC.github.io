In 2020, Shirin graduated from UCLA with a Bachelors of Science in Biology. After completing her undergraduate program, she was eager to learn more and decided to take classes at Santa Monica College. There she discovered my passion for computer science and am now completing coursework in the subject. Through an internship at NASAâ€™s Jet Propulsion Laboratory Shirin discovered bioinformatics, which is the perfect intersection between her two fields of interests. In the future Shirin hope to pursue this field academically as a graduate student.
