Anushka Rajesh is a graduate student pursuing her Master's in Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of Southern California School of Pharmacy. She graduated with a Bachelor's in Pharmacy degree from the University of Mumbai. She has prior research experience in core pharmaceutics and basic formulation, and is presently doing her thesis work in Bioinformatics under the guidance of Dr. Serghei Mangul. Her main project in the Mangul Lab involves working with public repositories and analyzing the metadata available on them using bioinformatics tools. Despite being a pharmacy student with little computational background, she chose to pursue a thesis in bioinformatics as she believes it is the perfect interface of healthcare and technology.
