Karishma Chhugani is a graduate student pursuing her Master's in Pharmaceutical Sciences at University of Southern California's School of Pharmacy. She graduated from University of California, Riverside in June 2019 with a Bachelor’s of Science in Cellular, Molecular, and Developmental Biology. During her undergraduate research career, she explored the mechanisms that relate to the biogenesis, stability, and modes of action of microRNAs in the plant: Arabidopsis Thaliana, focused on producing visual molecular dynamic simulations of Amyloid fibers related to Alzheimer’s disease using various software programs in Linux, and worked with Drosophila Melanogaster as an animal model to analyze neuronal systems of olfactory receptors. Karishma has interned with BioAtla, where she worked with antibodies and cell based therapeutics in cancer. She has also interned with Ferring Pharmaceuticals where she carried out experiments testing the equilibrium and kinetic solubility of various peptide compounds using Reverse Phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC). Karishma is currently working on benchmarking and analyzing the various RNA-seq and DNA-seq tools, along with writing commentaries on topics such as opportunities of computational research and the role of genomics in the COVID-19 pandemic. Outside of school and research, Karishma loves fashion, learning new languages, playing piano, and dancing.
