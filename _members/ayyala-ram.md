My research is centered on advancing bioinformatics methodologies, with a specific emphasis on the immunogenetics of the HLA region. My academic foundation in Neuroscience, earned from the University of California, Los Angeles, provides me with a robust biological perspective. I further honed my expertise with a Master's degree in both Computational Molecular Biology and Translational Biomedical Informatics from the University of Southern California, where I received comprehensive training in both computational biology and translational biomedical informatics. My work aims to bridge the gap between complex omics data and actionable insights in disease prediction and prevention.
