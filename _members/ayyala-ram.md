My research primarily focuses on improving bioinformatics techniques and exploring the field of immunogenetics, specifically the HLA region. I am a PhD student in the Department of Quantitative and Computational Biology at the University of Southern California. I have a strong biological background from my studies in Neuroscience at the University of California, Los Angeles. Additionally, I obtained a Master's degree in Translational Biomedical Informatics from the University of Southern California, where I received training in translational biomedical techniques.
