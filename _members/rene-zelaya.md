René graduated in 2012 with a B.A. in Engineering Sciences from Dartmouth College.
He started working as a programmer in the Integrative Genomics Lab during the spring of 2013.
His primary mission is to put our research advances into the hands of biologists.
He works with users to understand how we can make their lives easier through accessible computation.
He translates these conversations, in the context of our machine learning advances, into functionality embedded in webservers such as [GIANT](http://giant.princeton.edu/) and [Tribe](https://tribe.greenelab.com/#/home) that address key biological challenges.
René also managed the code review process in the lab, to keep the group thinking about both design and documentation principles.
