Brian Nadel is a lecturer at UCLA. He earned his PhD in bioinformatics at UCLA in 2020, and his undergraduate in Biology and Computer Science from Swarthmore College in 2014. He has worked extensively with microarray and Next Generation Sequencing data, specifically to study patterns in gene expression. His thesis focused on expression-based cell type deconvolution: the process of using expression data to infer the cell type content of heterogeneous tissue samples. He has also collaborated with researchers studying colorectal cancer, diabetes, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. He has also worked with leveraging single cell and spatial methods to study the development of hematopoietic stem cells.
