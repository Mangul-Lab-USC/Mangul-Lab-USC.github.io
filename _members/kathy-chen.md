Kathy was an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania studying [Biochemistry](http://www.sas.upenn.edu/biochem/) and [Computer Science](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/index.php).
She joined the Greene lab to learn more about the intersection of her two majors.
Kathy's project involved the identification of pathway-pathway relationships from genomic "big data" using patterns extracted by deep learning techniques.
She was a co-author on a [manuscript in Cell Systems describing the eADAGE method](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2017.06.003) and the primary author of a [manuscript describing the PathCORE software that she developed](https://doi.org/10.1101/147645).
Currently, she is a data scientist at the [Simons Foundation](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/).
She plans to continue developing and applying computational algorithms to address key challenges in the life sciences.
